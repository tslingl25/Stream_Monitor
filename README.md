## Week 1
+ We outlined some initial design fundamentals and diagrams. We also started to plan which components we had to order for our project to be succesful.
### Intial Design Diagrams

## Week 2
+ Created a part list of components we need to order we need to order
+ Search the lab for components we already have, found a functional tempature sensor and a LoRa
