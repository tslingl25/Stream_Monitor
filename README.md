## October
+ We outlined some initial design fundamentals and diagrams. We also started to plan which components we had to order for our project to be succesful. We found lots of interesting options, but we need to deciphyr which ones will work and which ones wont, as some of our options are a little sketchy to say the least. We found that we had a functional tempurture sensor so we didnt need to purchase one of those.

## November
- We delagated tasks, Thomas on CAD, and Nathaniel on code. We split up and got hard to work. The initial box design was a large 3d printed box, but due to manufacturing constraints, said box could not be manufactured and I had to find another way. The other way came in the form of precison fit lazer cut and 3d printed parts. Step one was creating the blue prints for the lazer cut shell. These flat pieces of presision machined material were to be held together through the use of solid, 3d extruded pla+ brackets. The adding of these brakcets throughout the assemby was a painstaking yet crucial proccess that took up the remainder of the great month of November.

## December
- Oh december. A majestic month. In this month I fortuitusly added all of the precision extruded pla+ parts to the computer aided design. Exquisitaly designed and maticulously combed over parts like the conduet holder and the conduet holder base were designed. Through precision engineering that is not only functional, but pleaseing to the visual observer, was produced. These parts mesh with each other like bread and butter, plugs and outlets, engineering, and art.

## January
- January, the heart of winter, the belly of the beast, the turning point of our project. This month was heavily assembly focused. In the assembly, lots of screws and small brackets needed to be installed. While good for haveing a robust box, this conundrum made assebly a task that required not only dextarity, but mental fortitude and determination. Throughout the month, these highly engineered and specialized fastiners were affized through any means possible. Drills, impact drivers, needle nose pliers, and even allen keys, we threw the workshop sink at it. By the end of this cold, dark month, a diamond emerged. A completed box that stands above all from a commanding throne.

## Febuary
- Winter has peaked and we are on the way to warmer, lighter times ahead. But dont let it fool you, this crescendo of the beast that is winter still has teeth. With a completed basic box, that was far from basic, it was time so solve some problems and get fancy. We needed a battery holder. I got to work on a battery holder in onshape. But since Febuary is not just any month, its the shortest one of the year, this battery holder had to have some style. With a tempurture radiant fin design and a sliding top cover, it was more then just stylish. It was a work of art that rivals the finast picasso. While the initial CAD design took a little while due to complexity, it went smoothly with relatively little hickups. Once printed out, one could see why artists strive for perfection, as said battery holder absolutely was.

## March
- You know what they say. March comes in like a lion and goes out like a lamb. It didnt. It came in like a lamb and went out like a lamb. This month was fraught with challenges. First step was a circuit diagram, on the white board it was created. It was time to do somthing i'd never done before. Soldier a circuit board. I had sokme troubles at first, sort of like the "troubles" in northern Ireland. The troubles were from the beginning, but without peace walls it got ugly, quick. Untill Mr.Miller showed me the stratigy, getting a good soldier joint between the wires and the headers was next to impossible. The strategy that Mr Miller showed me solved our troubles with the soldier joints as quickly as the good friday agreement of 1998. To get a good secure connection to the headers, you need to fashion the wire into a small loop and put it around the header, next, you heat up the header and feed the soldier into it to create a super secure soldier joint. Once I learned these little tricks, the circuit board soldiering went relatively smoothly. Except for one wire I soldiered onto the wrong place and promptly fixed it was suprisingly easy, though meticulous.

## April
- April, my birth month. This great month is full of joy and wonder, including the use of the first 7 days of the month for spring break. After that joyous time concluded, it was TIME TO GRIND. Whilst designing the box, many of the holes I put were for the wrong things, I know, DURRRRRRR. So I found the right bit, chucked it up, and got to drilling. Hole after hole, measurement after measurement, I got the modules bolted in place. Next step was to get everything hooked up and soldered into the modules. I had to make a beutiful extension cord and braid some wires together for it. This month is when I felt the consequences of not haveing a good electronic layout before cutting out he box. Never the less, This marked the completion of the wireing and structure of this project.

## May
- May, like the mayflower, upon which many of our ancestors sailed the ocean blue. During this month, some final tweaks to the code and wiring diagram were performed. A month frought with documentation and sorrow. Long hours typeing at the computor and presenting were acheived. A masterful presentation was excecuted with prescision.
